## Project Overview

**Domain Problem:** Who will take Top 3 for the Supercross 450 class event in Seattle?

**Objective:** The objective of this project is to predict the Top 3 podium finishers for the 450 Supercross class at the Seattle round taking place at Lumen Field on February 14th.

Supercross racing is highly stochastic due to factors such as rider crashes, start position variability, and rapidly changing track conditions, making exact predictions unreliable. As a result, this project approaches the problem mathematically by simulating race outcomes multiple times and evaluating the frequency with which riders finish on the podium.
